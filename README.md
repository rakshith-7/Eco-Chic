# *Hackathon Journey*


Recognized a pressing issue in the fast-fashion industry and decided to address it.

Engaged with users through in-person and online surveys to gain a comprehensive understanding of their pain points and areas for improvement.

Analyzed the survey data meticulously, prioritizing the identified pain points and establishing clear connections between user responses.

Utilized the Kano model, a widely recognized prioritization framework, to strategically determine the order in which features should be implemented.

Developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to gauge user reactions to the proposed features and identify northstar and counter metrics for evaluating its success.

Leveraged FIGMA, a popular design tool, to create a compelling prototype that showcased the implemented features and defined the user journey.

Presented the product to industry experts at a hackathon, garnering valuable feedback and securing an impressive 4th place out of 120 participating teams.
